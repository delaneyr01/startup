## HTML Updates (9-30)
In this update, I have added a month page where you can view your schedule at a month view, a week page where you can view your schedule at a week view with hourly time slots, and a theme page in which you can select the color of the page (this is not yet functioning without CSS). The index page also has a place to log in to access your schedule, a link to the rest of the pages, and a link to my GitHub. I also added a new icon for the tab. There is also a placeholder to add a new event, and in the future you will be able to tag other accounts in that event.
